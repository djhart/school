* Notes
** Mechanical energy of flow of fluid
** Heat :: form of energy hat is transferred by temp difference
*** always high -> low
*** Adiabatic :: no heat transfer
**** system well insulated
**** system and surroundings same temp
*** Conduction
**** object is heated molecules gain more energy and bump into nearby molecules, transferring energy
**** Fourier's law of conduction
***** rate of heat conduction through a plane in x direction
***** \[\dot Q_{cond} = -kA\frac{dt}{dx}\]
******  \[\frac{dT}{dx}\]: temp gradient in x direction
******* \[\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 \degree C\] delta T = T_2 - T_1 degrees C
******* delta x: layer thickness m
****** A: wall area
****** k: thermal conductivity of material
*** Convection
**** heat transfer between solid surface and adjacent fluid by movement of molecules of the liquid or gas
**** Forced convection :: fluid is forced to flow, increasing heat transfer
**** Newton's law of cooling
***** Qdot_conv = hA(T_s - T_f) ;; W
****** A: surface area ;; m^2
****** T_S: surface temp degrees C
****** T_f: fluid temp away from surface degrees C
****** h: convection coefficient W/m^2 * K
*** Radiation
**** Energy transfer by electromagnetic waves
**** does not require medium
**** Qdot = epsilon sigma A(T_b^4 - T_s^4) ;; W ;; net radiation exchange between surface at T_b and much larger surface at T_s < T_b
***** A: area of smaller surface
***** epsilon: emissivity, property of surface
***** sigma: Stefan-Boltzman constant: 5.67*10^8
** Work 
** Energy can cross boundary of closed system in form of heat or work.
** \[Power \; \dot W\]: Work per unit of time (J/s or Watts)
** \[W=Fs (J)\]: Work done by constant force in direction of displacement ;; s = displacement
** Sign Convention
*** W > 0: Work done by system
*** W < 0: Work done to system
*** Boundary work positive during expansion, negative during compression
*** Heat transfer to system is positive, from system is negative
** Systems have energy, not heat or work
*** Heat and work are associated with a process, not a state
*** Q and W are path functions (magnitude depends on the path as well as the end states)
*** differential is represented by \[\delta Q \; or \; \delta W\] not dQ or dW
