* Notes (ppt on ICON)
** 2/1/19 (substitute)
*** parabolic curves (sag vertical curve)
    - 0.5% minimum longitudinal slope for drainage
    - no minimum in rural (ditch drainage)
    - do not use superelevation in urban sections because of melt/refreeze
*** Pavement
    - asphalt is poor for trails (longitudinal cracks near edges and birdbaths)
    - concrete since 1980 has seen decrease in durability
      - concrete is more difficult to replace than asphalt
      - dowel bars used in horizontal joints for thickness > 8 in. for load transfer (destroys thinner concrete)
      - dowel bars reduce vertical displacement between sections
      - tie bars used in longitudinal joints to resist tension (joint spread - bike tires get stuck in these)
      - avoid longitudinal joints in bike lanes
      - don't leave joint patterns to contractor
      - align joints with traffic patterns
      - use joint patterns that facilitate repairs
      - overdesign trail thickness (min 6 inches)
    - texture
      - reduce noise, increase friction
        - bridges noisy with transverse tining
        - longitudinal tining preferable (no loss of friction)
        - diamong grind most quiet
    - Considerations
      - bus pullouts are good (bus drivers dont like them though)
      - manhole covers should not be in wheel path
      - snow storage and sidewalk should not overlap
      - how wide lanes?
        - consider snow intrusion
        - gutters convey storm water (too narrow lanes and vehicles splash water up)
      - water mains not under pavement
      - use discretion with regards to standards
      - road diet
        - 4 lane -> 3 lane
        - good if less than 15000 veh/day
      - curves reduce speed naturally
        - curves add manholes
      - storm sewer
        - grates better at steep inclines
** 2/4/19 (substitute)
*** Funding
    - ASCE :: report card - D infrastructure
              need $3.6 trillion infrastructure investment
    - Surface transportation :: funding
         gas tax (~$.30 state + ~$.184 federal)
           last raised 1992
         tolls
         registration
         tire/oil fees
         Moving to general tax funds
      - Federal aid :: generated by highway trust fund and portioned back to states where revenue is generated.
      - State aid :: Money from fuel taxes, registration, tire and truck sales. Portioned back to counties and cities.
      - Local :: a few counties/cities have taxes/fees but most rely heavily on property tax. Mostly spent on law enforcement. 
*** Finance
**** Debt Financing
     - Federal :: none (will change in future)
     - State ::
       - bonds - money borrowed and paid back w/ interest
         - Iowa doesn't use debt financing
       - Privatizing infrastructure (public-private partnerships)
     - Local :: Bonds
**** FAST Act 
     - Obama 12/4/15
     - first long-term act in a decade
     - 5 years/ $305 B $70 B transferred to highway trust
**** Impact on design
     - Federal
       - AASHTO standards and reviewsf
       - NEPA process
       - right-of-way acquisition regs
       - fed wage / material cost guidelines (pay union wage)
     - State revenue
       - state AASHTO
       - state env review
     - Local
       - standards
       - ordinances
**** Pub Private Partnerships (P3)
     - $1.4 trillion funding gap
     - private firm funds construction
     - tax cred 80%
     - tolls or access fee
** 2/6/19 (substitute)
*** Binomial Distribution
    - $P(X=x_)=\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x(1-p)^{(n-x)}$
** 2/11/19 (substitute) 
*** Regression
    - linear
      - single variable
      - multi variable
      - transformations
    - non-linear regression
      - binary variable
      - categorical variable
    - Single Variable
      - minimize sum of deviations \[S=\sum_{}^{}(Y_i-Ytilde_i)\]
      - y=a+bx
      - $=\sum_{}^{}(x_i-x*)NOTE finish and a too
